		BOX 1/2
		make box size icons

		// but i can't remember the reason. just the feeling.

	worry about soccer's girls and boys sites later
	worry about selecting the right golf by sport and year later
		// potentially we could do this by returning both Events, and pushing one's divisions to the other's, if they're different
			// or just getting one that is closest in time, depending on context

what the state app does:
	ADDS new orders by uploading files sent as email attachments
	// allows EDITing order quantities, including add ons
	VIEWS orders by sport and division, // split by gender as appropriate
	MARKS orders complete
	


what does this state app need to do:
	VIEW the next event on load
	PRINT data from orders. signature sheets for individual sites, original .txt files, box labels
	PRINT totals for a sport
	
	
/////
TODO:
/////
	
	autogenerate:
		box labels
		pick up sheets
		totals for Nancy
		invoice emails for add ons
		
	view/year works, but we'll want to go back some day, and change the db to support multiple vehicles and managers
		for an eventSite. also naming divisions by boys/girls for soccer
	and the ability to edit from the year view
		
	fix multi upload on live site
	
	i'd like to be able to upload the qualifiers, and compare orders against it
		also track which schools we're still missing
			add a css class for rows for schools we are still missing
	i'd like to be able to upload the year's schedule
	
	i'd like to have the sports page say how many more shirts we need total for incomplete orders
	
	we can handle fall/spring golf by just having a separate Event for each, and having them reference the same Sport
		we can worry about how to select (not just by sport and year) in the future. i suppose if we get two, 
			which should only happen for golf, we can include specific logic for that

	what happens when we try to add a school that is not yet in the DB. or a division.

	So, Whatâ€™s Next?
Try recursive joins for deep relationships.
Implement lazy loading via __get().
Optimize query performance with caching.
Add filtering/sorting to avoid unnecessary queries.

Suggested Previous Climbs
Mount Rainier is the tallest and most heavily glaciated of all the
Cascade Volcanoes. We suggest that you have made ascents of
some of the more challenging routes on the smaller volcanoes
or have significant experience in technical terrain. Due to the
complex glaciation and high elevation of Mount Rainier it is difficult
to approximate the challenge on other mountains. Some similar
routes would be:
1. Hotlum Glacier, Mt. Shasta
2. Easton Glacier, Mt. Baker
3. Leuthold Couloir, Mt. Hood
If you are new to this style of climbing, one possible progression
of climbs to complete, at a minimum before attempting the DC
route on Mount Rainier would be:
1. Mt. St. Helens, Monitor Ridge or Worm Flows
2. Mt. Hood, Hogback Glacier
3. Mt. Adams, South Side Climb
4. Mt. Shasta, Avalanche Gulch
5. Mt. Baker, Easton Glacier
