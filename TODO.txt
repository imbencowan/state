	need to fix our add order functions
		
	
	then we can work on our pdf generation
	
	make a renderer class to cut down on repeat code for displaying views
	
		// later tater
	allow manual entry of an order from a sport page
	
// SOME DAY
	improve context
	// i'll probably want to intstitute a way to select which relations to utilize
			// so an event can get all it's associated orders, or just it's basic info. 
	worry about soccer's girls and boys sites later
	worry about selecting the right golf by sport and year
		// potentially we could do this by returning both Events, and pushing one's divisions to the other's, if they're different
			// or just getting one that is closest in time, depending on context

what the state app does:
	ADDS new orders by uploading files sent as email attachments
	allows EDITing order quantities, including add ons
	VIEWS orders by sport and division, split by gender as appropriate
	MARKS orders complete
	


what does this state app need to do:
	VIEW the next event on load
	PRINT data from orders. signature sheets for individual sites, original .txt files, box labels
	PRINT totals for a sport
	
	
/////
TODO:
/////
	
	autogenerate:
		box labels
		pick up sheets
		totals for Nancy
		invoice emails for add ons
		
	view/year works, but we'll want to go back some day, and change the db to support multiple vehicles and managers
		for an eventSite. also naming divisions by boys/girls for soccer
	and the ability to edit from the year view
		
	fix multi upload on live site
	
	i'd like to be able to upload the qualifiers, and compare orders against it
		also track which schools we're still missing
	i'd like to be able to upload the year's schedule
	
	i'd like to have the sports page say how many more shirts we need total for incomplete orders
	
	we can handle fall/spring golf by just having a separate Event for each, and having them reference the same Sport
		we can worry about how to select (not just by sport and year) in the future. i suppose if we get two, 
			which should only happen for golf, we can include specific logic for that
	

///////////////////////////////////
TEST
	what happens when we try to add a school that is not yet in the DB. or a division.

	So, Whatâ€™s Next?
Try recursive joins for deep relationships.
Implement lazy loading via __get().
Optimize query performance with caching.
Add filtering/sorting to avoid unnecessary queries.
